# AMVML

Prediction of potential miRNA-disease associations based on adaptive multi-view multi-label learning

** Method Description **
AMVML is a computational framework that can effectively and reliably uncover potential disease-related miRNAs. It learns a new affinity graph adaptively for both diseases and miRNAs from multiple biological data sources. It also simultaneously update the miRNA-disease association predicted from both spaces based on multiple learning. In particular, the convergence of AMVML has been proved theoretically and the corresponding analysis indicates that it has a fast convergence rate. It is also worth mentioning that AMVML can be easily extended if there are more biological datasets available. 

** Requirements **
AMVML was developed in MATLAB 2014b environment, but it should be working in all MATLAB versions.
